	.section .content { padding: 0 10px; }  
	.sections { height: 150px; }

JS:
	$('.sections').hAccordion( );


OPTIONS
============================
Options are passed as a JavaScript object.  Possible options are as follows:

- section:		The container for each section of the accordion. In the above example,
				these were the divs classed as 'section'.  Default is 'section'.

- label:		The clickable part of the section.  It's recommended that you use divs
				for the labels.  In the above example, these were the divs classed as
				'label'.  Default is 'label'.

- duration:		This is passed straight through to the jquery-ui calls.  Default is
				750ms.

- easing:		This is passed straight through to the jquery-ui calls.  Default is
				'swing'.  The only other built in value is 'linear'.

- callback:		If a function is passed via this option, it is called once for each
				section when animation on that section is finished.

- selected:		The ID of the selected tab.  Once loaded, this tab will swing open.


WARNINGS
============================
hAccordion MAY break (well, it's not hAccordion's fault) if you use links with hash
hrefs as the labels for your sections if these hash names are also used as IDs of
elements.
